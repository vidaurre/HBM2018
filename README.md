These are the scripts for the manuscript 

Diego Vidaurre et al (2019). Stable between-subject statistical inference from unstable within-subject functional connectivity estimates. Human Brain Mapping

The script for the NPC method can be found in PermRegress/permtestmass_NPC.m

The main scripts used in the paper are: 

- demo.m: used to generate Figure 1
- synthetic_runs: used in Section 3 - Simulations.
- HCP_runs.m: used to run the HMM on the HCP data. 
- HCP_test.m: used to test the HMM runs on the HCP vs. behavioural variables.
